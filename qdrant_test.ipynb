    "### This notebook contains the code for RAG implementation with Qdrant DB for Proposal Pro backend\n",
    "Steps followed:\n",
    "- Upload files\n",
    "- for file in files:\n",
    "    - for each page in file: \n",
    "        - update metadata\n",
    "        - chunkify with metadata (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)\n",
    "        - append to a docs_list\n",
    "    - return docs_list\n",
    "    - update metadata for each chunk in docs_list:\n",
    "        - chunk.metadata.update({\"tags\": \"\", \"flename\": \"\"})\n",
    "    - get embedding model to use\n",
    "    - create embeddings for each chunk (OR):\n",
    "    - create/update vector DB with the docs_list, embedding model, using collection_name (creates embeddings too)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB Architecture \n",
    "### Approach 1:\n",
    "Each **Collection** in the Qdrant DB will be associated with a **Project**.\n",
    "The collections will be simple, Vector databases with: -\n",
    "\n",
    "- **collection_name**: *ProjectName_ProjectID*.\n",
    "- **VectorParams**: Size=1024, Distance=COSINE\n",
    "- **PointStruct**: id, vector=chunk_embedding, payload=chunk_metadata\n",
    "    - *chunk_metadata*= {filename, tags, page no., content src}\n",
    "\n",
    "A Qdrant collection can be viewed as a pool of embeddings from all the docs associated with a Project, with the chunk info (Filename, Page No.) maintained in the payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, query is sent to a Qdrant collection which returns the *Docs* with the closest match to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. Too many collections will be created. Each colleciton has:\n",
    "    - Its own HNSW index\n",
    "    - Its own metadata and memory footprint\n",
    "    - Background maintenance processes\n",
    " ***Conclusion***: Not feasible when the collection count exceeds beyond a few thousand\n",
    "2. Cross-project *search* is not possible with this approach. Searches like:\n",
    "    - “Search across all user projects”\n",
    "    - “Search across multiple teams”\n",
    "    - or some form of global context\n",
    "  become very hard because of isolation of each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A Qdrant instance with thousands of collections is more complex to move or manage than a single large collection with payload filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2:\n",
    "A **Collection** will hold all the data for all the projects in a single pool.\n",
    "The **Payload** to each chunk will contain the following info:\n",
    "- *userID*\n",
    "- *projectID*\n",
    "- *fileID*\n",
    "- *chunkID*\n",
    "- *text*\n",
    "- *fileURL_GCS*\n",
    "- *fileName*\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, we must *filter* the search query *userID* and *projectID*.\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. This approach results in cluttered storage of embeddings, as it appears\n",
