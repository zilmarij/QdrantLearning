    "### This notebook contains the code for RAG implementation with Qdrant DB for Proposal Pro backend\n",
    "Steps followed:\n",
    "- Upload files\n",
    "- for file in files:\n",
    "    <!-- update_vector_db.py -->\n",
    "    - for each page in file: \n",
    "        - update metadata\n",
    "        - chunkify with metadata (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)\n",
    "        - append to a docs_list\n",
    "    - return docs_list\n",
    "    - update metadata for each chunk in docs_list:\n",
    "        - chunk.metadata.update({\"tags\": \"\", \"flename\": \"\"})\n",
    "    - get embedding model to use\n",
    "    - create/update vector DB with the docs_list, embedding model, using collection_name (creates embeddings too)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB Architecture \n",
    "### Approach 1:\n",
    "Each **Collection** in the Qdrant DB will be associated with a **Project**.\n",
    "The collections will be simple, Vector databases with: -\n",
    "\n",
    "- **collection_name**: *ProjectName_ProjectID*.\n",
    "- **VectorParams**: Size=1024, Distance=COSINE\n",
    "- **PointStruct**: id, vector=chunk_embedding, payload=chunk_metadata\n",
    "    - *chunk_metadata*= {filename, tags, page no., content src}\n",
    "\n",
    "A Qdrant collection can be viewed as a pool of embeddings from all the docs associated with a Project, with the chunk info (Filename, Page No.) maintained in the payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, query is sent to a Qdrant collection which returns the *Docs* with the closest match to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros of this approach:\n",
    "1. One collection per project\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maximum isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fastest retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clean resource boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easy deletes and backup\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect for proposal-development application (where projects = main unit of work)\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. Too many collections will be created. Each colleciton has:\n",
    "    - Its own HNSW index (a high-perf indexing struct which performs search in logarithmic time)\n",
    "    - Its own metadata and memory footprint\n",
    "    - Background maintenance processes\n",
    " ***Conclusion***: *Not scalable* when the collection count exceeds beyond a few thousand\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross-project *search* is not possible with this approach. Searches like:\n",
    "    - “Search across all user projects”\n",
    "    - “Search across multiple teams”\n",
    "    - or some form of global context\n",
    "  become very hard because of isolation of each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A Qdrant instance with thousands of collections is more complex to move or manage than a single large collection with payload filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next approach overcomes these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2:\n",
    "A **Collection** will hold all the data for all the projects in a single pool.\n",
    "The **Payload** to each chunk will contain the following info:\n",
    "- *userID*\n",
    "- *projectID*\n",
    "- *fileID*\n",
    "- *chunkID*\n",
    "- *text*\n",
    "- *fileURL_GCS*\n",
    "- *fileName*\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, we must *filter* the search query *userID* and *projectID*.\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. This approach results in cluttered storage of embeddings, as it appears\n",
    "2. Search will be slower with filters and larger index\n",
    "3. This approach will result in more complex retrieval logic\n",
    "4. Buggy filter may result in data leak\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3:\n",
    "One **Collection** per **tenant**, or per **User**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 4:\n",
    "Use Named-Vectors\n",
    "\n",
