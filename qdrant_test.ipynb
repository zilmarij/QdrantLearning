    "### This notebook contains the code for RAG implementation with Qdrant DB for Proposal Pro backend\n",
    "Steps followed:\n",
    "- Upload files\n",
    "- for file in files:\n",
    "    <!-- update_vector_db.py -->\n",
    "    - for each page in file: \n",
    "        - update metadata\n",
    "        - chunkify with metadata (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)\n",
    "        - append to a docs_list\n",
    "    - return docs_list\n",
    "    - update metadata for each chunk in docs_list:\n",
    "        - chunk.metadata.update({\"tags\": \"\", \"flename\": \"\"})\n",
    "    - get embedding model to use\n",
    "    - create/update vector DB with the docs_list, embedding model, using collection_name (creates embeddings too)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB Architecture \n",
    "### Approach 1:\n",
    "Each **Collection** in the Qdrant DB will be associated with a **Project**.\n",
    "The collections will be simple, Vector databases with: -\n",
    "\n",
    "- **collection_name**: *ProjectName_ProjectID*.\n",
    "- **VectorParams**: Size=1024, Distance=COSINE\n",
    "- **PointStruct**: id, vector=chunk_embedding, payload=chunk_metadata\n",
    "    - *chunk_metadata*= {filename, tags, page no., content src}\n",
    "\n",
    "A Qdrant collection can be viewed as a pool of embeddings from all the docs associated with a Project, with the chunk info (Filename, Page No.) maintained in the payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, query is sent to a Qdrant collection which returns the *Docs* with the closest match to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros of this approach:\n",
    "1. One collection per project\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maximum isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fastest retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clean resource boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Easy deletes and backup\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect for proposal-development application (where projects = main unit of work)\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. Too many collections will be created. Each colleciton has:\n",
    "    - Its own HNSW index (a high-perf indexing struct which performs search in logarithmic time)\n",
    "    - Its own metadata and memory footprint\n",
    "    - Background maintenance processes\n",
    " ***Conclusion***: *Not scalable* when the collection count exceeds beyond a few thousand\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross-project *search* is not possible with this approach. Searches like:\n",
    "    - “Search across all user projects”\n",
    "    - “Search across multiple teams”\n",
    "    - or some form of global context\n",
    "  become very hard because of isolation of each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A Qdrant instance with thousands of collections is more complex to move or manage than a single large collection with payload filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next approach overcomes these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2:\n",
    "A **Collection** will hold all the data for all the projects in a single pool.\n",
    "The **Payload** to each chunk will contain the following info:\n",
    "- *userID*\n",
    "- *projectID*\n",
    "- *fileID*\n",
    "- *chunkID*\n",
    "- *text*\n",
    "- *fileURL_GCS*\n",
    "- *fileName*\n",
    "\n",
    "For ***Retrieval***, we must *filter* the search query *userID* and *projectID*.\n",
    "#### Cons to this approach:\n",
    "1. This approach results in cluttered storage of embeddings, as it appears\n",
    "2. Search will be slower with filters and larger index\n",
    "3. This approach will result in more complex retrieval logic\n",
    "4. Buggy filter may result in data leak\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3:\n",
    "One **Collection** per **tenant**, or per **User**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 4:\n",
    "Use Named-Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Initial notification shall be made to the CO as soon as OCI issues become known. OCI issues include, but are not limited to, the inability to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, the inability to objectively perform contract work, or the unfair competitive advantage created by current or previous contractual efforts with the Government. If an actual or potential OCI exists, the Offeror shall submit a mitigation plan with the proposal. The CO will review the submitted mitigation plan and determine whether the plan adequately resolves the issues and provides adequate protection to both the Offeror and the Government. Submission of mitigation plans are only required if the Offeror is aware of potential or actual OCI issues related to this procurement. If the Offeror believes no potential or actual OCI issues exist, the Offeror shall explicitly state to confirm.\\n\\n## organizational structure change history\\n\\nMany companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the period of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what technical experience is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination in the Government’s evaluation, the Offeror shall submit a narrative and/or visual “roadmap” that identifies all such company organization changes within the past five (5) years, and explains, as appropriate, how these changes impact the relevance of submitted work samples. Since the Government may also consider an Offeror’s prior experience information provided by other sources, your “roadmap” should be both specifically applicable to the work samples you identify and generally descriptive enough to inform the Government’s review of information it may receive from other sources (e.g., other customer organizations).\\n\\n## exceptions to terms and conditions\\n\\nOfferors are NOT permitted to take exceptions to any RFP terms and conditions. By submitting their proposal, the Offeror confirms their assent to all RFP terms and conditions.', 'chunk_index': 40}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",
